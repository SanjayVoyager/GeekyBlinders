## Introduction

LaneGuardian utilizes advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect vehicles that cut into lanes abruptly, which can be a common cause of accidents. By providing real-time alerts, this system aims to improve road safety and assist drivers in maintaining lane discipline.

## Features ✨

- 🚗 Real-time vehicle cut-in detection
- 💡 Advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques
- 🎯 High accuracy and low latency
- 🔌 Easy integration with existing systems
- ⚙️ Customizable for different use cases

## Installation 📦

### Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.7 or higher
- 📦 pip (Python package installer)
- 👁️ OpenCV
- 🤖 TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the chosen model)
- 📄 Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LaneGuardian.git
    cd LaneGuardian
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
